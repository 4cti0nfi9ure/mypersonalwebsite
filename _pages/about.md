Markus Wurzenberger is a scientist and project manager at [AIT Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at), located in Vienna, Austria. Since 2014 he is part of the [cyber security research group](https://www.ait.ac.at/themen/cyber-security) of AIT's Center for Digital Safety and Security. His main research interests are log data analysis with focus on anomaly detection and cyber threat intelligence (CTI). Besides the involvement in several international and national research projects, Markus is one of the key researchers working on AIT's anomaly detection project [AECID](https://aecid.ait.ac.at/). Among the most prominent solutions developed within this project, Markus and his team created [AMiner](https://github.com/ait-aecid/logdata-anomaly-miner), a software component for log analysis, which implements several anomaly detection algorithms that base on machine learning (ML) artificial intelligence (AI), and statistics. The AMiner is available as package in the official [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/sid/logdata-anomaly-miner) distribution.

In 2021, Markus finished his PhD in computer science at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/). His [thesis](https://catalogplus.tuwien.at/permalink/f/qknpf/UTW_alma21115580910003336) focused on resource-efficient log analysis to enable online anomaly detection in cyber security. In 2015 Markus obtained his master's degree in technical mathematics at the [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/). Since 2014 he is a full-time scientist at AIT in the area of cyber security.
