**Abstract:** Electronic components and systems are key drivers for the innovation capacity of European industries, large and small, generating economic growth and supporting meaningful jobs for citizens. They offer solutions to some of the difficult societal challenges addressing European policies for 2020 and beyond. For both reasons, it is vital that investments are made to assure European collaboration and the access to the technologies, know-how and manufacturing capabilities, which guarantee growth potential and strategic independence in the face of increased globalization.
