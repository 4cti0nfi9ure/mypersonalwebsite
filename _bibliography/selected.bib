  abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) secure all kinds of IT infrastructures through automatic detection of malicious activities. Unfortunately, they are known to produce large numbers of alerts that often become overwhelming for manual analysis. Therefore, aggregation methods have been developed for filtering, grouping, and correlating alerts. However, existing techniques either rely on manually defined attack scenarios or require specific alert formats, such as IDMEF that include IP addresses. This makes the application of existing aggregation methods infeasible for alerts from host-based or anomaly-based IDSs that frequently lack such network-related data. In this paper, we therefore present a domain-independent alert aggregation technique. We introduce similarity measures and merging strategies for arbitrary semi-structured alerts and alert groups. Based on these metrics and techniques we propose an incremental procedure for the generation of abstract alert patterns that enable continuous classification of incoming alerts. Evaluations show that our approach is capable of reducing the number of alert groups for human review by around 80\% and assigning attack classifiers to the groups with true positive rates of 80\% and false positive rates lower than 5\%.},

  abstract = {Evaluations of intrusion detection systems (IDS) require log datasets collected in realistic system environments. Existing testbeds therefore offer user simulations and attack scenarios that target specific use-cases. However, not only does the preparation of such testbeds require domain knowledge and time-consuming work, but also maintenance and modifications for other use-cases involve high manual efforts and repeated execution of tasks. In this article, we therefore propose to generate testbeds for IDS evaluation using strategies from model-driven engineering. In particular, our approach models system infrastructure, simulated normal behavior, and attack scenarios as testbed-independent modules. A transformation engine then automatically generates arbitrary numbers of testbeds, each with a particular set of characteristics and capable of running in parallel. Our approach greatly improves configurability and flexibility of testbeds and allows to reuse components across multiple scenarios. We use our proof-of-concept implementation to generate a labeled dataset for IDS evaluation that is published with this article.},

  abstract = {Log files give insight into the state of a computer system and enable the detection of anomalous events relevant to cyber security. However, automatically analyzing log data is difficult since it contains massive amounts of unstructured and diverse messages collected from heterogeneous sources. Therefore, several approaches that condense or summarize log data by means of clustering techniques have been proposed. Picking the right approach for a particular application domain is, however, non-trivial, since algorithms are designed towards specific objectives and requirements. This paper therefore surveys existing approaches. It thereby groups approaches by their clustering techniques, reviews their applicability and limitations, discusses trends and identifies gaps. The survey reveals that approaches usually pursue one or more of four major objectives: overview and filtering, parsing and signature extraction, static outlier detection, and sequences and dynamic anomaly detection. Finally, this paper also outlines a concept and tool that support the selection of appropriate approaches based on user-defined requirements.},

  abstract = {Technological advances and increased interconnectivity have led to a higher risk of previously unknown threats. Cyber Security therefore employs Intrusion Detection Systems that continuously monitor log lines in order to protect systems from such attacks. Existing approaches use string metrics to group similar lines into clusters and detect dissimilar lines as outliers. However, such methods only produce static views on the data and do not sufficiently incorporate the dynamic nature of logs. Changes of the technological infrastructure therefore frequently require cluster reformations. Moreover, such approaches are not suited for detecting anomalies related to frequencies, periodic alterations and interdependencies of log lines. We therefore propose a dynamic log file anomaly detection methodology that incrementally groups log lines within time windows. Thereby, a novel clustering mechanism establishes links between otherwise isolated collections of clusters. Cluster evolution techniques analyze clusters from neighboring time windows and determine transitions such as splits or merges. A self-learning algorithm then detects anomalies in the temporal behavior of these evolving clusters by analyzing metrics derived from their developments. We apply a prototype in an illustrative scenario consisting of a log file containing known anomalies. We thereby investigate the influences of certain parameters on the detection ability and the runtime. The evaluation of this scenario shows that 61.8% of the dynamic changes of log line clusters are correctly identified, while the false alarm rate is only 0.7%. The ability of efficiently detecting these anomalies while self-adjusting to changes of the system environment suggests the applicability of the introduced approach.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection based on white-listing and self-learning has proven to be a promising approach to detect customized and advanced cyber attacks. Anomaly detection aims at detecting significant deviations from normal system and network behavior. A well-known method to classify anomalous and normal system behavior is clustering of log lines. However, this approach has been applied for forensic purposes only, where log data dumps are investigated retrospectively. In order to make this concept applicable for on-line anomaly detection, i.e., at the time the log lines are produced, some major extensions to existing approaches are required. Especially distance based clustering approaches usually fail building the required large distance matrices and rely on time-consuming recalculations of the cluster-map on every arriving log line. An incremental clustering approach seems suitable to solve this issues. Thus, we introduce a semi-supervised concept for incremental clustering of log data that builds the basis for a novel on-line anomaly detection solution based on log data streams. Its operation is independent from the syntax and semantics of the processed log lines, which makes it generally applicable. We demonstrate that that the introduced anomaly detection approach allows to achieve both a high recall and a high precision while maintaining linear complexity.},
