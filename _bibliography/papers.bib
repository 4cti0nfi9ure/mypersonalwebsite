  abstract = {Intrusion detection systems are essential for network security. To verify their detection capabilities and facilitate comparison, benchmark log datasets are used to measure evaluation metrics such as accuracy and false alarm rates. Thereby, it is necessary that these datasets come with a correct ground truth that differentiates normal and attacker behavior. While it is relatively straightforward to generate labels for network-based datasets by selecting events according to IP addresses of attacker hosts, system logs do not necessarily involve such identifiers and are possibly only recognizable as malicious by their combined occurrences. Even more problems emerge when log data is collected in model-driven testbeds, i.e., automatically generated networks that simulate differently parameterized attack scenarios in diverse infrastructures. In these testbeds, parameters such as IP addresses are subject to change and thus cannot simply be used for matching. We thus propose a framework that integrates template-based labeling rules for model-driven testbeds. In this paper we describe the syntax for rule templates with different query types specifically designed to match sequential or interrelated system log events. An evaluation of our open-source implementation shows that only 27 rules are necessary to assign 15 labels to 8 system log files containing attack manifestations.},

  abstract = {Log data is a well-known source for anomaly detection in cyber security. Accordingly, a large number of approaches based on self-learning algorithms have been proposed in the past. Most of these approaches focus on numeric features extracted from logs, since these variables are convenient to use with commonly known machine learning techniques. However, system log data frequently involves multiple categorical features that provide further insights into the state of a computer system and thus have the potential to improve detection accuracy. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to derive useful correlation rules from the vast number of possible values of all available categorical variables. Therefore, we propose the Variable Correlation Detector (VCD) that employs a sequence of selection constraints to efficiently disclose pairs of variables with correlating values. The approach also comprises of an online mode that continuously updates the identified variable correlations to account for system evolution and applies statistical tests on conditional occurrence probabilities for anomaly detection. Our evaluations show that the VCD is well adjustable to fit properties of the data at hand and discloses associated variables with high accuracy. Our experiments with real log data indicate that the VCD is capable of detecting attacks such as scans and brute-force intrusions with higher accuracy than existing detectors.},

  abstract = {Evaluations of intrusion detection systems (IDS) require log data sets collected in realistic system environments. Existing testbeds therefore offer user simulations and attack scenarios that target specific use-cases. However, not only does the preparation of such testbeds require domain knowledge and time-consuming work, but also maintenance and modifications for other use-cases involve high manual efforts and repeated execution of tasks. We therefore propose to generate testbeds for IDS evaluation using strategies from model-driven engineering. In particular, our approach models system infrastructure, simulated normal behavior, and attack scenarios as testbed-independent modules. A transformation engine then automatically generates arbitrary numbers of testbeds, each with a particular set of characteristics and capable of running in parallel. Our approach greatly improves configurability and flexibility of testbeds and allows to reuse components across multiple scenarios. We use our proof-of-concept implementation to generate a labeled data set for IDS evaluation that is published with this paper.},

  abstract = {Log data analysis is an essential task when it comes to understanding a computer's or a network's system behavior, and enables security analysis, fault diagnosis, performance analysis, or intrusion detection. An established technique for log analysis is log line clustering, which allows to group similar events and to detect outliers, malicious clusters or changes in system behavior. However, log line clusters usually lack meaningful descriptions that are required to understand the information provided by log lines within a cluster. Template generators allow to produce such descriptions in form of patterns that match all log lines within a cluster and therefore describe the common features of the lines. Current approaches only allow generation of token-based (e.g., space-separated words) templates, which are often inaccurate, because they do not recognize words that can be spelled differently as similar and require further information on the structure and syntax of the data, such as predefined delimiters. Consequently, novel character-based template generators are required that provide robust templates for any type of computer log data, which can be applied in security information and event management (SIEM) solutions, for continuous auditing, quality inspection and control. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for computing character-based templates, which combines comparison-based methods and heuristics. To achieve this goal, we solve the problem of efficiently calculating a multi-line alignment for a group of log lines and compute an accurate approximation of the optimal character-based template, while reducing the runtime from O(n^m) to O(mn^2). We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in a detailed evaluation, applying a newly introduced measure for accuracy, the Sim-Score, which can be computed independently from a ground truth, and the established F-Score. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of the algorithm and the influence of different log data properties on the quality of the resulting templates.},

  abstract = {Monitoring syscall logs provides a detailed view on almost all processes running on a system. Existing approaches therefore analyze sequences of executed syscall types for system behavior modeling and anomaly detection in cyber security. However, failures and attacks that do not manifest themselves as type sequences violations remain undetected. In this paper we therefore propose to incorporate syscall parameter values with the objective of enriching analysis and detection with execution context information. Our approach thereby first selects and encodes syscall log parameters and then visualizes the resulting high-dimensional data using self-organizing maps to enable complex analysis. We thereby display syscall occurrence frequencies and transitions of consecutively executed syscalls. We employ a sliding window approach to detect changes of the system behavior as anomalies in the SOM mappings. In addition, we use SOMs to cluster aggregated syscall data for classification of normal a nd anomalous system behavior states. Finally, we validate our approach on a real syscall data set collected from an Apache web server. Our experiments show that all injected attacks are represented as changes in the SOMs, thus enabling visual or semi-automatic anomaly detection.},

However, the simple nature and limited validity of these indicators impairs protection against cyber threats. Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) provide abstract information on attacker behavior, but are only available in human-readable format that prevents automatic detection using IDSs. In this paper we therefore propose an approach that extracts cyber threat intelligence from raw log data and combines the advantages of IoCs and TTPs by producing detectable patterns of complex system behavior. Other than existing approaches, our approach employs log data anomaly detection to disclose suspicious log events, which are used for iterative clustering, pattern recognition, and refinement. Our evaluations show that automatically extracted threat intelligence corresponding to a multi-step attack is suitable for detection of the same attack on another system.},

  abstract = {Understanding a computer system's or network's behavior is essential for various tasks such as fault diagnosis, intrusion detection or performance analysis. A key source of information describing a system's current state is log data. However, accessing this information for further analysis is often complicated. Usually, log data is available in form of unstructured text lines and there exists no common standard for the appearance of logs. Hence, log parsers are required to pre-process log lines and structure their information for further analysis. State of the art log parsers still apply pre-defined lists of regular expressions, which are linearly processed and thus render online log analysis infeasible. Furthermore, defining log parsers manually is a cumbersome and time consuming task. Therefore, in this paper we propose AECID-PG, a novel log parser generator. AECID-PG implements a density-based approach to automatically generate a tree-like parser, which reduces the complexity of log parsing from O(n) to O(log(n)). We use real log data to evaluate AECID-PG and compare its parsing capabilities to other parser generator approaches by calculating the F-score. We prove AECID-PG's broad applicability and finally demonstrate its functionality in a real world setting.}

  abstract = {Anomaly detection on log data is an important security mechanism that allows the detection of unknown attacks. Self-learning algorithms capture the behavior of a system over time and are able to identify deviations from the learned normal behavior online. The introduction of clustering techniques enabled outlier detection on log lines independent from their syntax, thereby removing the need for parsers. However, clustering methods only produce static collections of clusters. Therefore, such approaches frequently require a reformation of the clusters in dynamic environments due to changes in technical infrastructure. Moreover, clustering alone is not able to detect anomalies that do not manifest themselves as outliers but rather as log lines with spurious frequencies or incorrect periodicity. In order to overcome these deficiencies, in this paper we introduce a dynamic anomaly detection approach that generates multiple consecutive cluster maps and connects them by deploying cluster evolution techniques. For this, we design a novel clustering model that allows tracking clusters and determining their transitions. We detect anomalous system behavior by applying time-series analysis to relevant metrics computed from the evolving clusters. Finally, we evaluate our solution on an illustrative scenario and validate the achieved quality of the retrieved anomalies with respect to the runtime.},

  abstract = {The industrial world is going through its fourth revolution also known as Industry 4.0. Modern industrial processes leverage advanced IT technologies to increase productivity and often combine multiple system concepts such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Cloud Computing. Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are key enablers of this revolution. In CPPS, raw materials, machines, and operations are interconnected to form a sophisticated network. Protecting them against advanced cyber-threats is a priority concern for the future implementation of Industry 4.0 applications. Any impairment of such systems can lead, in fact, to catastrophic damages resulting in a substantial financial loss for governments, companies, as well as endanger the safety of the society. The need for high availability and reliability of these systems is therefore the pillar guiding our research. This paper proposes the adoption of anomaly detection as a method to support self-adaptation in CPPS and to ensure flexibility, reliability, and protection of industrial environments against modern cyber threats. An anomaly detection mechanism can be employed to monitor, and learn the normal behavior of an industrial system, and to generate alerts when the observed events indicate abnormal activities. On this concept we base our work, and we demonstrate how timely identifying critical security events can enable, through the self-adaptation (e.g., triggering automatic configuration changes), an efficient protection of the CPPS against advanced threats, and an effective containment of their effects.}

  abstract = { In recent years, new forms of cyber attacks with an unprecedented sophistication level have emerged. Additionally, systems have grown to a size and complexity so that their mode of operation is barely understandable any more, especially for chronically understaffed security teams. The combination of ever increasing exploitation of zero day vulnerabilities, malware auto-generated from tool kits with varying signatures, and the still problematic lack of user awareness is alarming. As a consequence signature-based intrusion detection systems, which look for signatures of known malware or malicious behavior studied in labs, do not seem fit for future challenges. New, flexibly adaptable forms of intrusion detection systems (IDS), which require just minimal maintenance and human intervention, and rather learn themselves what is considered normal in an infrastructure, are a promising means to tackle today’s serious security situation. This paper introduces ÆCID, a new anomaly-based IDS appr oach, that incorporates many features motivated by recent research results, including the automatic classification of events in a network, their correlation, evaluation, and interpretation up to a dynamically-configurable alerting system. Eventually, we foresee ÆCID to be a smart sensor for established SIEM solutions. Parts of ÆCID are open source and already included in Debian Linux and Ubuntu. This paper provides vital information on its basic design, deployment scenarios and application cases to support the research community as well as early adopters of the software package.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection based on white-listing and self-learning has proven to be a promising approach to detect customized and advanced cyber attacks. Anomaly detection aims at detecting significant deviations from normal system and network behavior. A well-known method to classify anomalous and normal system behavior is clustering of log lines. However, this approach has been applied for forensic purposes only, where log data dumps are investigated retrospectively. In order to make this concept applicable for on-line anomaly detection, i.e., at the time the log lines are produced, some major extensions to existing approaches are required. Especially distance based clustering approaches usually fail building the required large distance matrices and rely on time-consuming recalculations of the cluster-map on every arriving log line. An incremental clustering approach seems suitable to solve this issues. Thus, we introduce a semi-supervised concept for incremental clustering of log data that builds the basis for a novel on-line anomaly detection solution based on log data streams. Its operation is independent from the syntax and semantics of the processed log lines, which makes it generally applicable. We demonstrate that that the introduced anomaly detection approach allows to achieve both a high recall and a high precision while maintaining linear complexity.},

  abstract = {Most of today’s security solutions, such as security information and event management (SIEM) and signature based IDS, require the operator to evaluate potential attack vectors and update detection signatures and rules in a timely manner. However, today’s sophisticated and tailored advanced persistent threats (APT), malware, ransomware and rootkits, can be so complex and diverse, and often use zero day exploits, that a pure signature-based blacklisting approach would not be sufficient to detect them. Therefore, we could observe a major paradigm shift towards anomaly-based detection mechanisms, which try to establish a system behavior baseline – either based on netflow data or system logging data – and report any deviations from this baseline. While these approaches look promising, they usually suffer from scalability issues. As the amount of log data generated during IT operations is exponentially growing, high-performance analysis methods are required that can handle this huge amount of data in real-time. In this paper, we demonstrate how high-performance bioinformatics tools can be applied to tackle this issue. We investigate their application to log data for outlier detection to timely reveal anomalous system behavior that points to cyber attacks. Finally, we assess the detection capability and run-time performance of the proposed approach.}

Threat actors have quickly learned of the value and potential impact of targeting CPS, and numerous tailored multi-stage cyber-physical attack campaigns, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), have been perpetrated in the last years. They aim at stealthily compromising systems' operations and cause severe impact on daily business operations such as shutdowns, equipment damage, reputation damage, financial loss, intellectual property theft, and health and safety risks. Protecting CIs against such threats has become as crucial as complicated. Novel distributed detection and reaction methodologies are necessary to effectively uncover these attacks, and timely mitigate their effects. Correlating large amounts of data, collected from a multitude of relevant sources, is fundamental for Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to establish cyber situational awareness, and allow to promptly adopt suitable countermeasures in case of attacks. In our previous work we introduced three methods for security information correlation. In this paper we define metrics and benchmarks to evaluate these correlation methods, we assess their accuracy, and we compare their performance. We finally demonstrate how the presented techniques, implemented within our cyber threat intelligence analysis engine called CAESAIR, can be applied to support incident handling tasks performed by SOCs.},

  abstract = {Protecting Critical Infrastructures (CIs) against contemporary cyber attacks has become a crucial as well as complex task. Modern attack campaigns, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), leverage weaknesses in the organization's business processes and exploit vulnerabilities of several systems to hit their target. Although their life-cycle can last for months, these campaigns typically go undetected until they achieve their goal. They usually aim at performing data exfiltration, cause service disruptions and can also undermine the safety of humans. Novel detection techniques and incident handling approaches are therefore required, to effectively protect CI's networks and timely react to this type of threats. Correlating large amounts of data, collected from a multitude of relevant sources, is necessary and sometimes required by national authorities to establish cyber situational awareness, and allow to promptly adopt suitable countermeasures in case of an attack. In this paper we propose three novel methods for security information correlation designed to discover relevant insights and support the establishment of cyber situational awareness.}

  abstract = {Since the number of cyber attacks by insider threats and the damage caused by them has been increasing over the last years, organizations are in need for specific security solutions to counter these threats. To limit the damage caused by insider threats, the timely detection of erratic system behavior and malicious activities is of primary importance. We observed a major paradigm shift towards anomaly-focused detection mechanisms, which try to establish a baseline of system behavior -- based on system logging data -- and report any deviations from this baseline. While these approaches are promising, they usually have to cope with scalability issues. As the amount of log data generated during IT operations is exponentially growing, high-performance security solutions are required that can handle this huge amount of data in real time. In this paper, we demonstrate how high-performance bioinformatics tools can be leveraged to tackle this issue, and we demonstrate their application to log data for outlier detection, to timely detect anomalous system behavior that points to insider attacks.},

  abstract = {The number and type of threats to modern information and communication networks has increased massively in the recent years. Furthermore, the system complexity and interconnectedness has reached a level which makes it impossible to adequately protect networked systems with standard security solutions. There are simply too many unknown vulnerabilities, potential configuration mistakes and therefore enlarged attack surfaces and channels. A promising approach to better secure today's networked systems is information sharing about threats, vulnerabilities and indicators of compromise across organizations; and, in case something went wrong, to report incidents to national cyber security centers. These measures enable early warning systems, support risk management processes, and increase the overall situational awareness of organizations. Several cyber security directives around the world, such as the EU Network and Information Security Directive and the equivalent NIST Framework, demand specifically national cyber security centers and policies for organizations to report on incidents. However, effective tools to support the operation of such centers are rare. Typically, existing tools have been developed with the single organization as customer in mind. These tools are often not appropriate either for the large amounts of data or for the application use case at all. In this paper, we therefore introduce a novel incident clustering model and a system architecture along with a prototype implementation to establish situational awareness about the security of participating organizations. This is a vital prerequisite to plan further actions towards securing national infrastructure assets.},

  abstract = {Today ICT networks are the economy's vital backbone. While their complexity continuously evolves, sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) become increasingly fatal for organizations. Numerous highly developed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) promise to detect certain characteristics of APTs, but no mechanism which allows to rate, compare and evaluate them with respect to specific customer infrastructures is currently available. In this paper, we present BAESE, a system which enables vendor independent and objective rating and comparison of IDSs based on small sets of customer network data.},
