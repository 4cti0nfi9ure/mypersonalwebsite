  abstract = {Automatic log file analysis enables early detection of relevant incidents such as system failures. In particular, self-learning anomaly detection techniques capture patterns in log data and subsequently report unexpected log event occurrences to system operators without the need to provide or manually model anomalous scenarios in advance. Recently, an increasing number of approaches leveraging deep learning neural networks for this purpose have been presented. These approaches have demonstrated superior detection performance in comparison to conventional machine learning techniques and simultaneously resolve issues with unstable data formats. However, there exist many different architectures for deep learning and it is non-trivial to encode raw and unstructured log data to be analyzed by neural networks. We therefore carry out a systematic literature review that provides an overview of deployed models, data pre-processing mechanisms, anomaly detection techniques, and evaluations. The survey does not quantitatively compare existing approaches but instead aims to help readers understand relevant aspects of different model architectures and emphasizes open issues for future work.},

  abstract = {Intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor system logs and network traffic to recognize malicious activities in computer networks. Evaluating and comparing IDSs with respect to their detection accuracies is thereby essential for their selection in specific use-cases. Despite a great need, hardly any labeled intrusion detection datasets are publicly available. As a consequence, evaluations are often carried out on datasets from real infrastructures, where analysts cannot control system parameters or generate a reliable ground truth, or private datasets that prevent reproducibility of results. As a solution, we present a collection of maintainable log datasets collected in a testbed representing a small enterprise. Thereby, we employ extensive state machines to simulate normal user behavior and inject a multi-step attack. For scalable testbed deployment, we use concepts from model-driven engineering that enable automatic generation and labeling of an arbitrary number of datasets that comprise repetitions of attack executions with variations of parameters. In total, we provide 8 datasets containing 20 distinct types of log files, of which we label 8 files for 10 unique attack steps. We publish the labeled log datasets and code for testbed setup and simulation online as open-source to enable others to reproduce and extend our results.},
