  abstract = {Behavior-based anomaly detection (AD) approaches for enterprise-IT security are not easily applicable to other domains, such as embedded devices and IoT nodes in cyber-physical systems. AD approaches are usually highly optimized for specific purposes, tightly bound to domain-specific technologies and rely on a specific syntax of investigated data. Data from cyber-physical systems is however highly diverse, often poorly documented and not easily ingested for automated analysis. AECID provides an anomaly detection approach, that monitors unstructured textual event data (i.e., log data), and implements self-learning for autonomous operation. A parser generator establishes a model of normal system behavior on top of observed events, which then can be leveraged to detect anomalies as deviations from that baseline. The unsupervised anomaly detection approaches of AECID apply machine learning techniques to perform sequence analysis, correlation analysis and statistical tests of events represented in log data. This paper discusses AECID's applicability in a building security system use case. A proof of concept demonstrates the effective detection of anomalies in log data of a building access control system stemming from card misuse, including stolen access cards and cloned cards.},

  abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) secure all kinds of IT infrastructures through automatic detection of malicious activities. Unfortunately, they are known to produce large numbers of alerts that often become overwhelming for manual analysis. Therefore, aggregation methods have been developed for filtering, grouping, and correlating alerts. However, existing techniques either rely on manually defined attack scenarios or require specific alert formats, such as IDMEF that include IP addresses. This makes the application of existing aggregation methods infeasible for alerts from host-based or anomaly-based IDSs that frequently lack such network-related data. In this paper, we therefore present a domain-independent alert aggregation technique. We introduce similarity measures and merging strategies for arbitrary semi-structured alerts and alert groups. Based on these metrics and techniques we propose an incremental procedure for the generation of abstract alert patterns that enable continuous classification of incoming alerts. Evaluations show that our approach is capable of reducing the number of alert groups for human review by around 80\% and assigning attack classifiers to the groups with true positive rates of 80\% and false positive rates lower than 5\%.},

  abstract = {Cyber security leverages intrusion detection systems that analyse log data and network traffic to disclose suspicious activities and protect networks against cyberattacks. Verifying the functionality and measuring the effectiveness of these detection systems is not trivial, since it usually is not desirable to launch actual attacks in an organisation’s productive infrastructure. Therefore, such evaluations are often carried out in isolated testbeds, i.e., simulated networks comprising components and applications that are representative of their real-world counterparts in terms of configuration, scale, and utilisation. However, setting up and maintaining such testbeds is complex and labour-intensive, particularly when experiments are required to be reproducible and adaptable. To alleviate these issues, we developed the Kyoushi Testbed Environment, an open-source simulation framework that enables automatic and parallel testbed instantiation through model-driven design, simulation of normal user activities to generate a baseline workload, injection of attack scenarios with variations, and labelling of collected log data.},

  abstract = {Evaluations of intrusion detection systems (IDS) require log datasets collected in realistic system environments. Existing testbeds therefore offer user simulations and attack scenarios that target specific use-cases. However, not only does the preparation of such testbeds require domain knowledge and time-consuming work, but also maintenance and modifications for other use-cases involve high manual efforts and repeated execution of tasks. In this article, we therefore propose to generate testbeds for IDS evaluation using strategies from model-driven engineering. In particular, our approach models system infrastructure, simulated normal behavior, and attack scenarios as testbed-independent modules. A transformation engine then automatically generates arbitrary numbers of testbeds, each with a particular set of characteristics and capable of running in parallel. Our approach greatly improves configurability and flexibility of testbeds and allows to reuse components across multiple scenarios. We use our proof-of-concept implementation to generate a labeled dataset for IDS evaluation that is published with this article.}

In fact, enterprise IT, facility management, smart manufacturing, energy grids, industrial IoT, fintech, and other domains, operate interconnected systems, which follow predefined processes and are employed according to specific usage policies. The events generated by the systems governed by these processes are usually recorded for maintenance, accountability, or auditing purposes. Such records contain valuable information that can be leveraged to detect any inconsistencies or deviations in the processes, and indicate anomalies potentially caused by attacks, misconfigurations or component failures.

Unfortunately, today’s security solutions that are used for enterprise information technology (IT) infrastructures are not sufficient to protect CPS, which have largely different properties, involve heterogeneous technologies, and have an architecture that is tailored to specific physical processes. The objective of the synERGY project was to develop new methods, tools and processes for cross-layer anomaly detection (AD) to enable the early discovery of both cyber- and physical-attacks with impact on CPS. To this end, synERGY developed novel machine learning approaches to understand a system’s normal behaviour and detect consequences of security issues as deviations from the norm. The solution proposed by synERGY are flexibly adaptable to specific CPS layers, thus improving the detection capabilities. Moreover, synERGY interfaces with various organizational data sources, such as asset databases, configuration management, and risk data to facilitate the semi-automatic interpretation of detected anomalies. The synERGY approach was evaluated in a utility provider’s environment. This paper reports on the general architecture and the specific pitfalls that needed to be solved, during the design, implementation and deployment of the synERGY system. We foresee this work to be of benefit for researchers and practitioners, who design and implement security systems that correlate massive data from computer logs, the network or organizational context sources, to timely detect cyber attacks.},

  abstract = {Log files give insight into the state of a computer system and enable the detection of anomalous events relevant to cyber security. However, automatically analyzing log data is difficult since it contains massive amounts of unstructured and diverse messages collected from heterogeneous sources. Therefore, several approaches that condense or summarize log data by means of clustering techniques have been proposed. Picking the right approach for a particular application domain is, however, non-trivial, since algorithms are designed towards specific objectives and requirements. This paper therefore surveys existing approaches. It thereby groups approaches by their clustering techniques, reviews their applicability and limitations, discusses trends and identifies gaps. The survey reveals that approaches usually pursue one or more of four major objectives: overview and filtering, parsing and signature extraction, static outlier detection, and sequences and dynamic anomaly detection. Finally, this paper also outlines a concept and tool that support the selection of appropriate approaches based on user-defined requirements.},

  abstract = {Technological advances and increased interconnectivity have led to a higher risk of previously unknown threats. Cyber Security therefore employs Intrusion Detection Systems that continuously monitor log lines in order to protect systems from such attacks. Existing approaches use string metrics to group similar lines into clusters and detect dissimilar lines as outliers. However, such methods only produce static views on the data and do not sufficiently incorporate the dynamic nature of logs. Changes of the technological infrastructure therefore frequently require cluster reformations. Moreover, such approaches are not suited for detecting anomalies related to frequencies, periodic alterations and interdependencies of log lines. We therefore propose a dynamic log file anomaly detection methodology that incrementally groups log lines within time windows. Thereby, a novel clustering mechanism establishes links between otherwise isolated collections of clusters. Cluster evolution techniques analyze clusters from neighboring time windows and determine transitions such as splits or merges. A self-learning algorithm then detects anomalies in the temporal behavior of these evolving clusters by analyzing metrics derived from their developments. We apply a prototype in an illustrative scenario consisting of a log file containing known anomalies. We thereby investigate the influences of certain parameters on the detection ability and the runtime. The evaluation of this scenario shows that 61.8% of the dynamic changes of log line clusters are correctly identified, while the false alarm rate is only 0.7%. The ability of efficiently detecting these anomalies while self-adjusting to changes of the system environment suggests the applicability of the introduced approach.},

  abstract = {Today Information and Communications Technology (ICT) networks are a dominating component of our daily life. Centralized logging allows keeping track of events occurring in ICT networks. Therefore a central log store is essential for timely detection of problems such as service quality degradations, performance issues or especially security-relevant cyber attacks. There exist various software tools such as security information and event management (SIEM) systems, log analysis tools and anomaly detection systems, which exploit log data to achieve this. While there are many products on the market, based on different approaches, the identification of the most efficient solution for a specific infrastructure, and the optimal configuration is still an unsolved problem. Today׳s general test environments do not sufficiently account for the specific properties of individual infrastructure setups. Thus, tests in these environments are usually not representative. However, testing on the real running productive systems exposes the network infrastructure to dangerous or unstable situations. The solution to this dilemma is the design and implementation of a highly realistic test environment, i.e. sandbox solution, that follows a different – novel – approach. The idea is to generate realistic network event sequence (NES) data that reflects the actual system behavior and which is then used to challenge network analysis software tools with varying configurations safely and realistically offline. In this paper we define a model, based on log line clustering and Markov chain simulation to create this synthetic log data. The presented model requires only a small set of real network data as an input to understand the complex real system behavior. Based on the input׳s characteristics highly realistic customer specified NES data is generated. To prove the applicability of the concept developed in this work, we conclude the paper with an illustrative example of evaluation and test of an existing anomaly detection system by using generated NES data.},
