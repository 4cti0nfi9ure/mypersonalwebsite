  abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) monitor all kinds of IT infrastructures to automatically detect malicious activities related to cyber attacks. Unfortunately, especially anomaly-based IDS are known to produce large numbers of alerts, including false positives, that often become overwhelming for manual analysis. However, due to a fast changing threat landscape, quickly evolving attack techniques, and ever growing number of vulnerabilities, novel anomaly detection systems that enable detection of unknown attacks are indispensable. Therefore, to reduce the number of alerts that have to be reviewed by security analysts, aggregation methods have been developed for filtering, grouping, and correlating alerts. Yet, existing techniques either rely on manually defined attack scenarios or require specific alert formats, such as IDMEF that includes IP addresses. This makes the application of existing aggregation methods infeasible for alerts from host-based or anomaly-based IDSs that frequently lack such network-related data. In this chapter, we present a domain-independent alert aggregation technique that enables automatic attack pattern mining and generation of actionable CTI. The chapter describes the concept of the proposed alert aggregation process as well as a dashboard that enables visualization and filtering of the results. Finally, the chapter demonstrates all features in course of an application example.},

  abstract = {For many years signature-based intrusion detection has been applied to discover known malware and attack vectors. However, with the advent of malware toolboxes, obfuscation techniques and the rapid discovery of new vulnerabilities, novel approaches for intrusion detection are required. System behavior analysis is a cornerstone to recognizing adversarial actions on endpoints in computer networks that are not known in advance. Logs are incrementally produced textual data that reflect events and their impact on technical systems. Their efficient analysis is key for operational cyber security. We investigate approaches beyond applying simple regular expressions, and provide insights into novel machine learning mechanisms for parsing and analyzing log data for online anomaly detection. The AMiner is an open source implementation of a pipeline that implements many machine learning algorithms that are feasible for deeper analysis of system behavior, recognizing deviations from learned models and thus spotting a wide variety of even unknown attacks.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides an introduction into the concepts of information sharing, and introduces different sources of information that are currently used to identify cybersecurity incidents on a system or corporate level. It highlights their benefits and shortcomings and describes the common setup of monitoring infrastructures. The chapter also provides details about analysis methods that combine information from multiple sources in different ways to derive higher-level alerts. These concepts include signature-based approaches, anomaly detection, stateful analysis, and ontologies. As cyber threat intelligence is shared in the form of indicators or threat intelligence reports, asset management is vital for an organization to filter information streams. Effective use of this information requires efficient asset management processes be in place to identify the potentially vulnerable components in the managed network. Centralized logging makes log management much easier and simplifies the correlation of information collected at different locations of a network.},
